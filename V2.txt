Subject: Farewell and Best Wishes

Dear all,

 It is with mixed emotions that I write 
 to inform you that I will be departing 
 from my position at CIB BNPParibas. 
 
 My time here has been incredibly rewarding, 
 and I am grateful for the opportunities
 Iâ€™ve had to grow both personally and professionally.

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude 
to each and every one of you for your support,
guidance, and camaraderie throughout my
job at the banque.

While I am sad to say goodbye, I am 
also excited about the new adventures
and challenges that lie ahead. Please
know that I will cherish the memories
and experiences shared with you, and 
I hope our paths will cross again in 
the future.

Thank you once again for everything, 
and I wish you all continued success
and fulfillment in your endeavors.

Warmest regards,

Samir LACHIHEB
